## Setup
To set up the project, all you have to do is double-click on `configure-path.bat` script to run it. This will set up your database directory path dynamically.
Have the latest Visual Studio with **.NET desktop development** workload installed. Open the PassMan.sln solution file within the IDE then just simply build and run the project.
## Demo
I provided a demo user and some dummy data to test. Of course you can also register and create your own user and vault. 

At the login page, you can use the information below:
- **username**: `demo`
- **password**: `123`
